Space Complexity Words:

-Space, Usage, Consumption, Footprint


Graphs:
- Circular Dependency: My neighbor needs to wait for my result from the recursive call.
- Dijkstra Algorithm: Can solve any single-source shortest path problem in any directed graph with non-negative weights

- Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Can solve any single-source shortest path problem in a weighted directed graph with any weights, including negative weights.
